This is an example post

...and this is some text

Use [GitHub flavoured](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to format your posts. 


Categories are free-form (no predefined taxonomy), separated by spaces in the Jekyll front-matter.

Blog posts live in the ```_posts``` folder. The file name format is inflexible. You can assign a date in the future and the post won't appear until that date.

See ['Jekyll 101: Creating a new post and page'](https://michaelsoolee.com/jekyll-post-page/) for more info.
